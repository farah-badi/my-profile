 			<h2>Video Games ʕ੭·͡ᴥ·ʔ੭</h2>
 			<p> 
 			I've been playing video games since I was a kid, when I wanted to spend time with my brother and took interest in his hobby. Ever since, I have been playign a lot and love this world so much that I wanted to follow this in my career. I was interested in studying animation or game designing to be part of the creation of video games.

 			<h2>Cinematography \(๑•́o•̀๑)/</h2>
 			<p> 
 			I recently discovered a real passion for films and cinematography and thought about a career in filmaking. My favorite genre is psychological thriller and my goal is to watch all the "classics" and maybe one day, start creating some projects myself.

 			<h2>Fashion (´∀｀)♡</h2>
 			<p> 
 			Fashion and style are so interesting, you can express yourself freely and communicate what you want with others thanks to it ! Another one of my dream is creating a eco-friendly brand or start a sort of online thrifting business with vintage designer brands.
